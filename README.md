# Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java

Topics covered:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Trees
* Hashtables
* Stacks
* Queues
* Heaps
* Sort algorithms
* Search algorithms

**Conclusion**

Learnt the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of data structures, so I can choose the best data structure for data
and applications.
Coded an implementation of each data structure, so to understand how they work under the covers.
Learnt many of the algorithms commonly used to sort data, so applications will perform efficiently when sorting large
datasets.
Learnt what’s available in the JDK for storing and sorting data, so I won’t waste time reinventing the wheel.

`After completing this course, I have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms`
